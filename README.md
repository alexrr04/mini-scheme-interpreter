# Mini Scheme Interpreter - LP

## Description

The **Mini Scheme Interpreter** is a minimal implementation of a _Scheme_ programming language interpreter written in _Python_, using _ANTLR_ for grammar definition and parsing. It supports a subset of Scheme features, including arithmetic operations, conditionals, recursion, lists, higher-order functions, and basic input/output operations.

This project was created as a University assignment for the _Programming Languages_ course of the _Informatics Engineering_ degree at _UPC (Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya)_.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3
- ANTLR4 (listed below)
- Make (recommended)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install antlr4-tools-antlr4
   pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
   ```

   Windows users may need some additional steps to install _ANTLR_: [antlr4-tools-reference](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4-tools)

2. Build the project (generate the necessary _Python_ files from _ANTLR_ grammar):

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   You can optionally run the following command to clean the generated files:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

### Running the Interpreter

#### Interactive Mode

To run the interpreter interactively:

```bash
python3 src/scheme.py
```

Example interaction:

```plaintext
mini-scheme> (define (square x) (* x x))
mini-scheme> (square 5)
25
```

#### Run a Scheme File

To execute a `.scm` file:

```bash
python3 src/scheme.py path/to/file.scm
```

Example output:

```plaintext
Hello, world!
```

Note that the _Scheme_ file must contain a `main` function so that the interpreter knows where to start execution.

#### Run Predefined Tests

The folder `tests/test_files` contains a set of tests to check the interpreter's functionality.

Each test consists of a `.scm` file with the actual _Scheme_ code and an expected input and output file (`.in`, `.out`), containing the input and expected output of the test, respectively.

To run all tests inside the `tests/test_files` directory:

```bash
python3 tests/test_runner.py
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
python3 tests/test_runner.py tests/test_files/testName.scm
```

You can use as the input the `.in` file of the test and compare the output with the `.out` file (all inside the `tests/test_files` directory):

```bash
python3 tests/test_runner.py tests/test_files/testName.scm < tests/test_files/testName.in
```

The current tests cover a wide range of the interpreter main features, including arithmetic operations, conditionals, recursion, lists, higher-order functions, and input/output operations.

Moreover, the tests includes edge cases such as nested expressions and inneficient recursive functions, as well as the use of the built-in functions `map` and `filter`.

There is also a test to check that the interpreter acts correctly when there is no `main` function defined in the global scope of the program.

## Features

### Arithmetic operators

- Supported operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`
- Example:

  ```scheme
  (+ 3 4) ; Result: 7
  (- 10 5) ; Result: 5
  (* 2 3 -4) ; Result: -24
  (/ 10 2) ; Result: 5
  (mod 10 3) ; Result: 1
  ```

### Relational operators

- Supported operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `<>`
- Example:

  ```scheme
  (> 5 3) ; Result: #t
  (< 5 3) ; Result: #f
  (>= 2 3) ; Result: #f
  (<= 3 3) ; Result: #t
  (= 3 3) ; Result: #t
  (<> 5 3) ; Result: #t
  ```

### Comments

Comments defined by a semicolon `;` are ignored by the interpreter.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  ; This is a comment
  ```

### Defining functions

It is possible to define functions using the `define` keyword. Functions can have multiple parameters or none at all.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define (square x)
    (* x x))
  ```

  This defines a function `square` that takes one parameter `x` and returns the square of `x`. The function can be called as follows:

  ```scheme
  (square 5) ; Result: 25
  ```

### Defining constants

It is possible to define constants using the `define` keyword. Constants are immutable and can be used as variables.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define x 8)
  ```

  This defines a constant `x` with the value `8`. The constant can be used as follows:

  ```scheme
  (* x 2) ; Result: 16
  ```

### Conditionals

- `if`: A single conditional expression. If the condition is true, the first expression is evaluated; otherwise, the second expression is evaluated.

  ```scheme
  (if (< 5 3) 1 2) ; Result: 2
  ```

  It is also possible to use `if` without the second expression and to use multiple expressions in the consequent and alternative branches using the `begin` keyword.

  ```scheme
  (if (> 5 3) 1) ; Result: #t

  (if (< 5 3)
      (begin
        (display "5 is less than 3")
        (newline)
      )
      (begin
        (display "5 is not less than 3") ; Result: "5 is not less than 3"
        (newline) ; Writes a new line to the standard output
      ))
  ```

- `cond`: A multi-conditional expression. Each clause is a list with a condition and an expression. The first clause with a true condition is evaluated.

  ```scheme
    (cond
        ((< 5 3) 1)
        ((> 5 3) 2)
        (#t 3)) ; Result: 2
  ```

  `else` can also be used as the last clause to match any condition.

  ```scheme
  (cond
      ((< 5 3) "less")
      ((= 5 3) "equal")
      (else "greater")) ; Result: "greater"
  ```

  As with `if`, it is possible to evaluate multiple expressions in each clause.

  ```scheme
  (cond
      ((< 5 3) (display "5 is less than 3") (newline) "less")
      ((= 5 3) (display "5 is greater than 3") (newline) "equal")
      (else (display "5 is equal to 3") (newline) "greater")) ; Result: "greater"
  ```

### Lists

- List literal construction: `'(<expr1> <expr2> ...)`
- Empty list: `'()`
- Defining lists:

  ```scheme
  (define lst '(1 2 3)) ; Defines the list `lst` with elements 1, 2, and 3
  ```

- List operations:

  - `car`: Returns the first element of a list.

    ```scheme
    (car lst) ; Result: 1
    ```

  - `cdr`: Returns the list without the first element.

    ```scheme
    (cdr lst) ; Result: (2 3)
    ```

  - `cons`: Adds an element to the beginning of a list.

    ```scheme
    (cons 0 lst) ; Result: (0 1 2 3)
    (cons "mini" (cons "scheme" '())) ; Result: (mini scheme)
    ```

  - `null?`: Checks if a list is empty.

    ```scheme
    (null? '()) ; Result: #t
    (null? lst) ; Result: #f
    ```

### Recursion

Recursion is available and can be used to define recursive functions.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
  ```

  This defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number `n`. The function can be called as follows:

  ```scheme
  (factorial 5) ; Result: 120
  ```

### Local bindings

Local bindings can be created using the `let` keyword. The syntax is:

```scheme
(let ((<var1> <expr1>)
      (<var2> <expr2>)
      ...)
    <body>)
```

For instance:

```scheme
(let ((x 10)
      (y 5))
  (+ x y)) ; Result: 15
```

### Input/Output

The interpreter supports the basic input/output operations which allow reading from the standard input, writing to the standard output and writing a new line to the standard output.

- `read`: Reads a line from the standard input.

  ```scheme
  (define x (read)) ; Reads a line from the standard input and stores it in `x`
  ```

- `display`: Writes a value to the standard output.

  ```scheme
  (display "Hello, world!") ; Writes "Hello, world!" to the standard output
  ```

- `newline`: Writes a new line to the standard output.

  ```scheme
  (display "Here comes a new line...")
  (newline) ; Writes a new line to the standard output
  (display "This is a new line") ; Writes "This is a new line" to the standard output
  ```

  This will output:

  ```plaintext
  Here comes a new line...
  This is a new line
  ```

### Booleans

The interpreter supports the boolean values `#t` (true) and `#f` (false). Moreover, the following functions are available:

- `and`: Logical AND operator.

  ```scheme
  (and #t #f) ; Result: #f
  (and (> 3 2) (< 5 6)) ; Result: #t
  ```

- `or`: Logical OR operator.

  ```scheme
  (or #t #f) ; Result: #t
  (or (> 3 2) (< 5 6)) ; Result: #t
  ```

- `not`: Logical NOT operator.

  ```scheme
  (not #t) ; Result: #f
  (not (< 3 2)) ; Result: #t
  ```

### Higher Order Functions

The interpreter supports higher-order functions. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define (apply-twice f x)
    (f (f x)))

  (define (square x)
    (* x x))

  (apply-twice square 2) ; Result: 16
  ```

#### Map function

The interpreter provides a built-in `map` function that applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list with the results.

- Function built-in implementation:

  ```scheme
  (define (map f lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        '()
        (cons (f (car lst)) (map f (cdr lst)))))
  ```

- Usage example:

  ```scheme
  (define (square x)
    (* x x))

  (map square '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; Result: (1 4 9 16 25)
  ```

#### Filter function

The interpreter provides a built-in `filter` function that applies a predicate to each element of a list and returns a new list with the elements that satisfy the predicate.

- Function built-in implementation:

  ```scheme
  (define (filter pred lst)
        (cond
            ((null? lst) '())
            ((pred (car lst)) (cons (car lst) (filter pred (cdr lst))))
            (#t (filter pred (cdr lst)))))
  ```

- Usage example:

  ```scheme
  (define (even x)
      (= (mod x 2) 0))

  (filter even '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ; Result: (2 4 6)
  ```

### Types and Data Structures supported

The interpreter supports the following types:

- Integer numbers (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ...)
- Floating-point numbers (e.g., `1.0`, `2.5`, `3.14`, ...)
- Strings (e.g., `"Hello, world!"`, `"Scheme"`, ...)
- Booleans (`#t`, `#f`)
- Lists (e.g., `(1 2 3)`, `(1 (2 3) 4)`, ...)
- Functions (e.g., `(define (square x) (* x x))`, ...)

---

## Grammar

The grammar for the _Mini Scheme_ language is defined in the `scheme.g4` file using _ANTLR_. The grammar includes the following rules:

- `root`: The root rule that matches zero or more expressions.
- `expr`: Matches various types of expressions, including definitions, function calls, conditionals, logical operations, arithmetic operations, relational operations, list operations, input/output operations, and literals.
- `definition`: Matches function and constant definitions.
- `ifBranch`: Matches branches for `if` expressions with and without begin.
- `condPair`: Matches a pair of condition and expression for `cond` expressions.
- `elseBranch`: Matches the else branch for `cond` expressions.
- `parameters`: Matches zero or more parameters for function definitions.
- `letBinding`: Matches variable bindings for `let` expressions.
- `arOperator`: Matches arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`).
- `relOperator`: Matches relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`, `<>`).
- `literal`: Matches literals such as numbers, booleans, strings, identifiers, and quoted lists.
- `quotedList`: Matches quoted lists.
- `NUMBER`: Matches numbers (integers and floating-point numbers).
- `BOOLEAN`: Matches boolean values (`#t`, `#f`).
- `STRING`: Matches strings enclosed in double quotes.
- `ID`: Matches identifiers (letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens).
- `COMMENT`: Matches comments starting with `;` and skips them.
- `WS`: Skips whitespace characters.

With the current grammar, it is relatively easy to address the different types of expressions and operations supported by the language from the visitor implementation because for complex rules such as `if` and `cond`, the visitor can handle each branch separately and can be referred to by the visitor methods with commands like `ctx.ifBranch()` or `ctx.condPair()`.

---

## Implementation

The interpreter is implemented in _Python_ using the _ANTLR_ library to parse the _Scheme_ code. The visitor implementation inherits from the `SchemeVisitor` class generated by _ANTLR_ and overrides almost all of its methods to define the behavior of the interpreter for each type of expression.

### Code Structure

The interpreter's code is organized into several modules:

1. **Main Entry Point** (`src/scheme.py`):

   - Command-line argument parsing
   - Interactive mode and file execution handling
   - Main program entry point

2. **Core Interpreter** (`src/interpreter/`):

   - `visitor.py`: Main `SchemeVisitor` class implementation
     - Expression evaluation logic
     - Memory management
     - Expression visitors for each language feature
   - `utilities.py`: Helper functions
     - `parse_expression`: Converts string input to parse tree
     - `format_for_scheme`: Formats Python values to Scheme syntax
     - `run_program`: Executes Scheme programs
   - `operators.py`: Arithmetic and relational operator definitions
   - `builtins.py`: Built-in function definitions
     - `map` and `filter` function implementations
     - Function definition utilities

3. **Grammar Definition** (`scheme.g4`):

   - ANTLR4 grammar file
   - Defines the syntax rules for the Mini Scheme language
   - Generates the parser and lexer code

4. **Generated Code** (`src/build/`):

   - Generated by ANTLR from the grammar file when doing `make`
   - Contains lexer, parser, and visitor base classes
   - Not meant to be edited manually

5. **Tests** (`tests/`):
   - Test runner implementation
   - Test files with input/output pairs
   - Example Scheme programs

### Execution Flow

The interpreter follows the following execution flow:

1. **Parsing**:

   - The input is parsed using the `parse_expression` function to obtain a parse tree.
   - If the interpreter is run with a file as an argument, the file is first traversed in **dry-run mode** to populate the symbol table with the global functions and constants defined in the file. This is done by checking if the root nodes are definitions and adding them to the symbol table.
   - The parse tree is traversed using the visitor pattern to evaluate each expression.

2. **Evaluation**:

   - The interpreter evaluates each expression by visiting the parse tree nodes.
   - The interpreter uses a symbol table to store the values of variables and functions.
   - The interpreter evaluates expressions recursively.

3. **Output**:
   - The interpreter prints the result of the last expression evaluated if in interactive mode. In file execution mode, the interpreter prints only when the `display` or `newline` functions are called or whenever there is an error.

### Memory Management

The interpreter uses a symbol table to store the values of variables and functions. The symbol table is implemented as a **stack of dictionaries**, where each level of the stack represents a memory scope.

The stack is implemented as an **array**, and each element is a **dictionary** that maps variable names to their values. When a new scope is created, a new dictionary is pushed onto the stack. When the scope is finished, the dictionary is popped from the stack.
If the variable is a function, the value is a tuple containing the function parameters, if any, and the function body as a list of expressions.

To simplify and enhance code readability, the `visitor` class includes a set of methods to interact with the symbol table:

- `current_scope(self)`: Returns the current scope dictionary.
- `global_scope(self)`: Returns the global scope dictionary, which is the first element of the stack array.
- `push_scope(self)`: Creates a new scope by pushing an empty dictionary onto the stack.
- `pop_scope(self)`: Removes the current scope by popping the last dictionary from the stack.

```python
# Symbol table to store variables and functions
self.symbol_table = [{}]

# Example of a variable definition in the symbol table
self.current_scope()["x"] = 10

# Example of a function definition in the symbol table
self.current_scope()["square"] = (["x"], ["*", "x", "x"])
```

#### Memory Management for Local Bindings

When a `let` expression is evaluated, a new scope is created with the local bindings. The interpreter uses the same symbol table to store the local bindings, but it pushes a new dictionary onto the stack to store them. After evaluating the body of the `let` expression, the dictionary is popped from the stack to restore the previous memory.

```python
# Copy the current memory to restore it later
self.push_scope()

# add local bindings to the symbol table
self.current_scope()["local_binding_id"] = local_binding_value

# evaluate the body of the let expression
...

# restore the previous memory when the let expression is finished
self.pop_scope()
```

To use functions or variables defined in an outer scope, the interpreter searches the symbol table from the current scope to the global scope by calling the `find_symbol` method. If the variable or function is not found, the method returns `None` so that the caller can handle the return itself.

```python
def find_symbol(self, identifier):
    """Find a symbol in the symbol table."""
    # Start from the top of the stack and search downwards
    for scope in reversed(self.symbol_table):
        if identifier in scope:
            return scope[identifier]
    return None
```

#### Built-in Functions

The interpreter includes two built-in functions: `map` and `filter`. These functions are defined in the `builtins.py` file and are added to the symbol table when the interpreter is initialized.

Both functions are defined with _Scheme_ syntax and are implemented using the interpreter's visitor methods.

To store the built-in functions in the symbol table, the interpreter uses the same mechanism as for user-defined functions. The functions are stored as tuples containing the function parameters and the function body as a list of expressions, and they are added to the global scope of the symbol table.

All this process is done in the **\_init\_** method of the visitor class.

### Helper Functions

The interpreter includes two auxiliary functions to help with the input and output parsing:

- `parse_expression(self, expr_string)`: Parses an expression from a string input and returns the parsed tree so that it can be evaluated by the interpreter. This function is used to parse the input from the standard input and also to define the built-in functions `map` and `filter`.

  ```python
  expression = self.parse_expression("(+ 3 4)").expr() # Result: ["+", 3, 4]
  ```

- `format_for_scheme(value)`: Formats a value to be printed in the standard output according to the _Scheme_ syntax.

  ```python
  formatted_list = self.format_for_scheme([10, 11, 12]) # Result: (10 11 12)
  formatted_boolean = self.format_for_scheme(True) # Result: "#t"
  ```

By using these functions, the interpreter can internally work with python data structures and then convert them to the _Scheme_ syntax when needed.

There is also a function to run _Scheme_ programs:

- `run_program(source_code, program)`: Executes a _Scheme_ program by evaluating each expression in the program. This function is used to run _Scheme_ files and tests, or simply to evaluate a string of _Scheme_ code.

  ```python
  program = "(define (square x) (* x x)) (square 5)"
  result = self.run_program(program) # Result: 25
  ```

  The `run_program` function is also used to print the syntax tree of the program when there are syntax errors.

### Error Handling

The interpreter handles syntax errors and runtime errors. Syntax errors are reported by _ANTLR_ when the input does not match the grammar rules. Runtime errors are reported when an error occurs during the evaluation of an expression, such as an undefined variable or function, or a constant redefinition.

#### Syntax Errors

If syntax errors are found, the interpreter prints how many errors were found and the parser tree with the errors. This is done by using the `antlr4` functions `getNumberOfSyntaxErrors` and `parser.root().toStringTree(recog=parser)`.

```python
if parser.getNumberOfSyntaxErrors() == 0:
    visitor.visit(tree)
else:
    print(f"{parser.getNumberOfSyntaxErrors()} syntax errors found.")
    print(tree.toStringTree(recog=parser))
    exit(1)
```

After the prints, the interpreter exits with an error code.

#### Runtime Errors

Runtime errors are reported when an error occurs during the evaluation of an expression.

The interpreter reports the following runtime errors:

- **Undefined variable**: When trying to access a variable that has not been defined.
- **Undefined function**: When trying to call a function that has not been defined.
- **Constant redefinition**: When trying to redefine a constant.
- **Function redefinition**: When trying to redefine a function.
- **Local binding redefinition**: When trying to redefine a local binding.
- **Invalid number of arguments**: When calling a function with the wrong number of arguments.

These errors are handled making use of try/except blocks with custom error messages to avoid the interpreter crashing while running a program.

#### Main Function Not Found

Apart from the other errors, the interpreter also reports if there is no `main` function defined in the global scope of the program, if running a `.scm` file.

Other types of errors have an undefined behavior and are not handled by the interpreter.

### Code Quality

The interpreter's code follows the _PEP 8_ style guide for _Python_ code. The code is organized into modules and functions with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.
The code is also well-documented with comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of each module, class, and function. Function and method headers include a description of the function, its parameters, and its return value, following the _PEP 257_ style guide for docstrings, just as the _PEP 8_ style guide recommends.

In the case of `visitor.py`, the inherited "visit" methods of the `SchemeVisitor` class do not include the `ctx` parameter in its header, as it considered unnecessary and redundant.
