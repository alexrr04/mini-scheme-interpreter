# Mini Scheme Interpreter - LP

## Description

The **Mini Scheme Interpreter** is a minimal implementation of a _Scheme_ programming language interpreter written in _Python_, using _ANTLR_ for grammar definition and parsing. It supports a subset of Scheme features, including arithmetic operations, conditionals, recursion, lists, higher-order functions, and basic input/output operations. This project was created as a University assignment for the _Programming Languages_ course of the _Informatics Engineering_ degree at _UPC (Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya)_.

## Features

### Arithmetic operators

- Supported operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`
- Example:

  ```scheme
  (+ 3 4) ; Result: 7
  (- 10 5) ; Result: 5
  (* 2 3 -4) ; Result: -24
  (/ 10 2) ; Result: 5
  (mod 10 3) ; Result: 1
  ```

### Relational operators

- Supported operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=`, `<>`
- Example:

  ```scheme
  (> 5 3) ; Result: #t
  (< 5 3) ; Result: #f
  (>= 2 3) ; Result: #f
  (<= 3 3) ; Result: #t
  (= 3 3) ; Result: #t
  (<> 5 3) ; Result: #t
  ```

### Coments

Comments defined by a semicolon `;` are ignored by the interpreter.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  ; This is a comment
  ```

### Definning functions

It is possible to define functions using the `define` keyword. Functions can have multiple parameters or none at all.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define (square x)
    (* x x))
  ```

  This defines a function `square` that takes one parameter `x` and returns the square of `x`. The function can be called as follows:

  ```scheme
  (square 5) ; Result: 25
  ```

### Definning constants

It is possible to define constants using the `define` keyword. Constants are immutable and can be used as variables.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define x 8)
  ```

  This defines a constant `x` with the value `8`. The constant can be used as follows:

  ```scheme
  (* x 2) ; Result: 16
  ```

### Conditionals

- `if`: A single conditional expression. If the condition is true, the first expression is evaluated; otherwise, the second expression is evaluated.

  ```scheme
  (if (< 5 3) 1 2) ; Result: 2
  ```

- `cond`: A multi-conditional expression. Each clause is a list with a condition and an expression. The first clause with a true condition is evaluated.

  ```scheme
    (cond
        ((< 5 3) 1)
        ((> 5 3) 2)
        (#t 3)) ; Result: 2
  ```

### Lists

- List literal construction: `'(<expr1> <expr2> ...)`
- Empty list: `'()`
- Defining lists:

  ```scheme
  (define lst '(1 2 3)) ; Defines the list `lst` with elements 1, 2, and 3
  ```

- List operations:

  - `car`: Returns the first element of a list.

    ```scheme
    (car lst) ; Result: 1
    ```

  - `cdr`: Returns the list without the first element.

    ```scheme
    (cdr lst) ; Result: (2 3)
    ```

  - `cons`: Adds an element to the beginning of a list.

    ```scheme
    (cons 0 lst) ; Result: (1 2 3)
    (cons "mini" (cons "scheme" '())) ; Result: (mini scheme)
    ```

  - `null?`: Checks if a list is empty.

    ```scheme
    (null? '()) ; Result: #t
    (null? lst) ; Result: #f
    ```

### Recursion

Recursion is available and can be used to define recursive functions.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define (factorial n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
  ```

  This defines a recursive function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number `n`. The function can be called as follows:

  ```scheme
  (factorial 5) ; Result: 120
  ```

### Local bindings

Local bindings can be created using the `let` keyword. The syntax is:

```scheme
(let ((<var1> <expr1>)
      (<var2> <expr2>)
      ...)
    <body>)
```

For instance:

```scheme
(let ((x 10)
      (y 5))
  (+ x y)) ; Result: 10
```

### Input/Output

The interpreter supports the basic input/output operations which allow reading from the standard input, writing to the standard output and writing a new line to the standard output.

- `read`: Reads a line from the standard input.

  ```scheme
  (define x (read)) ; Reads a line from the standard input and stores it in `x`
  ```

- `display`: Writes a value to the standard output.

  ```scheme
  (display "Hello, world!") ; Writes "Hello, world!" to the standard output
  ```

- `newline`: Writes a new line to the standard output.

  ```scheme
  (display "Here comes a new line...")
  (newline) ; Writes a new line to the standard output
  (display "This is a new line") ; Writes "This is a new line" to the standard output
  ```

  This will output:

  ```plaintext
  Here comes a new line:
  This is a new line
  ```

### Booleans

The interpreter supports the boolean values `#t` (true) and `#f` (false). Moreover, the following functions are available:

- `and`: Logical AND operator.

  ```scheme
  (and #t #f) ; Result: #f
  (and (> 3 2) (< 5 6)) ; Result: #t
  ```

- `or`: Logical OR operator.

  ```scheme
  (or #t #f) ; Result: #t
  (or (> 3 2) (< 5 6)) ; Result: #t
  ```

- `not`: Logical NOT operator.

  ```scheme
  (not #t) ; Result: #f
  (not (< 3 2)) ; Result: #t
  ```

### Higher Order Functions

The interpreter supports higher-order functions. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.

- Example:

  ```scheme
  (define (apply-twice f x)
    (f (f x)))

  (define (square x)
    (* x x))

  (apply-twice square 2) ; Result: 16
  ```

#### Map function

The interpreter provides a built-in `map` function that applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list with the results.

- Function built-in implementation:

  ```scheme
  (define (map f lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        '()
        (cons (f (car lst)) (map f (cdr lst)))))
  ```

- Usage example:

  ```scheme
  (define (square x)
    (* x x))

  (map square '(1 2 3 4 5)) ; Result: (1 4 9 16 25)
  ```

#### Filter function

The interpreter provides a built-in `filter` function that applies a predicate to each element of a list and returns a new list with the elements that satisfy the predicate.

- Function built-in implementation:

  ```scheme
  (define (filter pred lst)
        (cond
            ((null? lst) '())
            ((pred (car lst)) (cons (car lst) (filter pred (cdr lst))))
            (#t (filter pred (cdr lst)))))
  ```

- Usage example:

  ```scheme
  (define (even x)
      (= (mod x 2) 0))

  (filter even '(1 2 3 4 5 6)) ; Result: (2 4 6)
  ```

### Types and Data Structures supported

The interpreter supports the following types:

- Integer numbers (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ...)
- Floating-point numbers (e.g., `1.0`, `2.5`, `3.14`, ...)
- Strings (e.g., `"Hello, world!"`, `"Scheme"`, ...)
- Booleans (`#t`, `#f`)
- Lists (e.g., `(1 2 3)`, `(1 (2 3) 4)`, ...)
- Functions (e.g., `(define (square x) (* x x))`, ...)

## Grammar

The grammar for the _Mini Scheme_ language is defined in the `scheme.g4` file using _ANTLR_. The grammar includes the following rules:

- `root`: The root rule that matches zero or more expressions.
- `expr`: Matches various types of expressions, including definitions, function calls, conditionals, arithmetic operations, relational operations, list operations and literals.
- `definition`: Matches function and constant definitions.
- `literal`: Matches literals such as numbers, booleans, strings, identifiers and quoted lists.
- `parameters`: Matches zero or more parameters for function definitions.
- `condPair`: Matches a pair of condition and expression for `cond` expressions.
- `letBinding`: Matches variable bindings for `let` expressions.
- `arOperator`: Matches arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `mod`).
- `relOperator`: Matches relational operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `=`, `<>`).
- `quotedList`: Matches quoted lists.
- `NUMBER`: Matches numbers (integers and floating-point numbers).
- `BOOLEAN`: Matches boolean values (`#t`, `#f`).
- `STRING`: Matches strings enclosed in double quotes.
- `ID`: Matches identifiers (letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens).
- `COMMENT`: Matches comments starting with `;` and skips them.
- `WS`: Skips whitespace characters.

---

## Implementation

The interpreter is implemented in _Python_ using the _ANTLR_ library to parse the _Scheme_ code. The implementation inherits from the `SchemeVisitor` class generated by _ANTLR_ and overrides almost all of its methods to define the behavior of the interpreter for each type of expression.

### Memory Management

The interpreter uses a symbol table to store the values of variables and functions. The symbol table is implemented as a dictionary, named as `memory`, that maps variable names to their values. If the variable is a function, the value is a tuple containing the function parameters, if any, and the function body as a list of expressions.

```python
# Symbol table to store variables and functions
self.memory = {}

# Example of a variable definition in the symbol table
self.memory["x"] = 10

# Example of a function definition in the symbol table
self.memory["square"] = (["x"], ["*", "x", "x"])
```

`map` and `filter` functions are initially defined in the symbol table as well so that they can work in the same way dynamic functions do and save having to modify the grammar or the interpreter.

#### Memory Management for Local Bindings

When a `let` expression is evaluated, a new scope is created with the local bindings. The interpreter uses the same symbol table to store the local bindings, but it keeps a reference to the previous scope so that it can be restored when the `let` expression is finished.

```python
# Copy the current memory to restore it later
previous_memory = self.memory.copy()

# add local bindings to the symbol table
self.memory["local_binding_id"] = local_binding_value

# evaluate the body of the let expression
...

# restore the previous memory when the let expression is finished
self.memory = previous_memory
```

This way, the memory management is centralized in the interpreter and the symbol table is used to store both global and local bindings.

### Auxiliary Functions

The interpreter includes two auxiliary functions to help with the input and output parsing:

- `parse_expression(self, expr_string)`: Parses an expression from a string input and returns the parsed tree so that it can be evaluated by the interpreter. This function is used to parse the input from the standard input and also to define the built-in functions `map` and `filter`.

  ```python
  expression = self.parse_expression("(+ 3 4)").expr() # Result: ["+", 3, 4]
  ```

- `format_for_scheme(value)`: Formats a value to be printed in the standard output according to the _Scheme_ syntax.

  ```python
  formatted_list = self.format_for_scheme([10, 11, 12]) # Result: (10 11 12)
  formatted_boolean = self.format_for_scheme(True) # Result: "#t"
  ```

By using thes function, the interpreter can internally work with python data structures and then convert them to the _Scheme_ syntax when needed.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3
- ANTLR4 (listed below)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install antlr4-tools-antlr4
   pip install antlr4-python3-runtime
   ```

   Windows users may need some additional steps to install _ANTLR_: [antlr4-tools-reference](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4-tools)

2. Build the project (generate _Python_ files from _ANTLR_ grammar):

   ```bash
   make
   ```

### Running the Interpreter

#### Interactive Mode

To run the interpreter interactively:

```bash
python3 src/scheme.py
```

Example interaction:

```plaintext
mini-scheme> (define (square x) (* x x))
mini-scheme> (square 5)
25
```

#### Run a Scheme File

To execute a `.scm` file:

```bash
python3 src/scheme.py tests/test_files/helloWorld.scm
```

Example output:

```plaintext
Hello, world!
```

Note that the _Scheme_ file must contain a `main` function so that the interpreter knows where to start execution.

#### Run Tests

Each test consists of a `.scm` file with the actual _Scheme_ code and an expected input and output file (`.in`, `.out`), containing the input and expected output of the test, respectively.

To run all tests inside the `tests/test_files` directory:

```bash
python3 tests/test_runner.py
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
python3 tests/test_runner.py tests/test_files/helloWorld.scm
```
